# Classificacao-de-Doenca-Cardiovascular
## Introduction
On this notebook, we'll be testing some ML models to predict the presence or absence of heart diseases over the [Heart Disease Classification Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorodrigues01/Classificacao-de-Doenca-Cardiovascular/main/HeartAttack.csv) which can be found on Kaggle. \
The algorithms used to classify the models are: Logistic Regression, k Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees, which their performances shall be taken into comparison to indetify the best classifier among these 3.

## Data
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle, but the data was published by Erbil Polytechnic from University of Kurdistan Hewler.
